Case Zero ‚Äî Multiplayer Detective Game (WIP)

üéØ Concept

Case Zero is an immersive, AI-driven detective game where players solve mysteries by analyzing documents, images, and clues generated dynamically by AI. The gameplay focuses on critical thinking, deduction, and collaboration rather than graphics or action. Players sift through AI-created evidence to identify the culprit and crack the case.

The game supports single-player mode initially, with plans to expand into a multiplayer mode where players collaborate or compete to solve cases in real time.

üöÄ Features (Planned)
	‚Ä¢	AI-generated cases: Each case contains a title, autopsy reports, suspects, and visual clues (documents, photos).
	‚Ä¢	Interactive clue analysis: Players explore and decode documents and images.
	‚Ä¢	Multiplayer gameplay: Real-time sessions with multiple players, sharing clues and making group decisions.
	‚Ä¢	Authentication: Secure login using Supabase + Google OAuth.
	‚Ä¢	Minimalist UI: Clean, document-centric interface with subtle animations.
	‚Ä¢	Responsive web app: Built with Next.js + TailwindCSS for fast, modern UI.
	‚Ä¢	State management: Zustand for simple and scalable state handling.
	‚Ä¢	Animations: Framer Motion for smooth UI transitions and engaging effects.
	‚Ä¢	Backend: Python FastAPI server for AI case generation and game logic.
	‚Ä¢	Real-time features: Supabase real-time subscriptions or WebSockets for multiplayer syncing.

üéÆ Gameplay Flow (Single Player)
	1.	Player logs in with Google via Supabase Auth.
	2.	Player selects or starts a new case.
	3.	Frontend requests AI-generated case data from backend:
	‚Ä¢	JSON with case title, autopsy, suspects, documents, image descriptions.
	4.	AI generates document images & clues on the backend (or via integrated AI APIs).
	5.	Player navigates through clues:
	‚Ä¢	Views documents and images.
	‚Ä¢	Analyzes text & hidden hints.
	‚Ä¢	Takes notes or marks suspects.
	6.	Player submits their conclusion (choosing the culprit).
	7.	Backend evaluates and provides feedback (correct/incorrect).
	8.	Player can retry or start a new case.

‚∏ª

üîÑ Multiplayer Mode (Future)
	‚Ä¢	Players join the same case lobby.
	‚Ä¢	Clues and findings are shared in real time.
	‚Ä¢	Players discuss and vote on the culprit.
	‚Ä¢	Backend manages game state sync via Supabase realtime or WebSocket.
	‚Ä¢	Competitive or cooperative modes.
